Update on Team 16's GitHub Repository and Clarification Regarding Contributor Issue

Dear Professor Galyna Tabunshchyk,

I am writing on behalf of Team 16 to provide you with an update regarding our GitHub repositories for the Java class assignments and to address a matter concerning one of our team members.

As you are aware, we encountered difficulties initially in pushing individual parts of our code to the group GitHub repository. Consequently, we opted to upload the entire project for each of the five hometask assignments as a whole before the deadlines. After discussing the issue in class on Friday, December 22, and seeking your guidance, we are pleased to inform you that we have resolved the GitHub problem. Now, each team member commited and pushed their respective code to different branches, with the complete project code consolidated in the main branch.

For your convenience, here are the links to the old repositories, which contain the complete project code for each homework assignment before their deadlines:

1. HA 1: https://github.com/JavaTeam16/HomeTask1-ExceptionHandling-
2. HA 2: https://github.com/JavaTeam16/Hometask2
3. HA 3: https://github.com/JavaTeam16/HomeTask3
4. HA 4: https://github.com/JavaTeam16/HomeTask4
5. HA5: (the repository "HA 5 NEW" was created before deadline of HA5, so there is no HA 5 old repository)

Simultaneously, we have created new repositories where individual team members commited and pushed their respective codes. The main branch in these repositories contains the consolidated project code:

1. HA 1 NEW: https://github.com/JavaTeam16/HomeTask1-New
2. HA 2 NEW: https://github.com/JavaTeam16/HomeTask2-New
3. HA 3 NEW: https://github.com/JavaTeam16/HomeTask3-New
4. HA 4 NEW: https://github.com/JavaTeam16/HomeTask4-New
5. HA 5 NEW: https://github.com/JavaTeam16/HomeTask5-New 

We kindly ask you to review the old repositories to ascertain the dates of our homework submissions and the new repositories to assess each team member's individual contributions.

Additionally, one of our team members, Zahra Paya, utilized a separate GitHub account, "Ghazal Hadian1989," to contribute to two repositories. We would like to clarify that Ghazal Hadian is not part of our team, and her actions on the separate account do not represent Team 16's collaborative efforts. We wish to assure you that we were unaware of Zahra Paya's actions, and her contributions with another account do not reflect our team's commitment to integrity and collaboration.

We kindly request your understanding and assistance in addressing this matter. If there are any consequences or actions required, we believe they should be directed solely towards Ms. Paya, as her actions were independent of our team's collective efforts.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We appreciate your support and look forward to your guidance on this matter.
